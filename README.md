A starter project that I'll be using for introducing Android development to students of [Software Design and Architecture](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~m2nagapp/courses/CS446/1225/) at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). 

If you're attending my lectures on May 25 and May 30, please make sure that you're able to build this project on your computer. If you're able to see this screen on your device/emulator then you're good to go!

Otherwise, please follow the official guide for setting up and troubleshooting any problems with Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-compose-unit-1-pathway-2
